# Machine-Learning-Data-Preprocessing
# 🤖 Machine Learning Data Preprocessing Project

This project focuses on **fundamental concepts of Machine Learning** and the complete **data preprocessing pipeline**.  
It covers both theory and hands-on Python implementation, making it a good reference for beginners starting with ML.  

## 📚 Concepts Covered

- Difference between **AI, ML, DL, and Data Science**  
- Types of Machine Learning with real-world examples  
- Overfitting, Underfitting & Bias-Variance tradeoff  
- Outliers and techniques to handle them  
- Handling missing values (numerical & categorical)  
- Creating synthetic imbalanced datasets  
- One-Hot Encoding using pandas  
- Handling missing values with imputation (with visualization)  
- Min-Max Scaling with sklearn  
- End-to-end **data preparation plan** for a retail dataset (handling missing data, outliers, imbalance, encoding)  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Google Colab  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  

## 📁 How to Use

1. Open the `.ipynb` notebook in **Google Colab**.  
2. Run the cells in sequence (theory in Markdown, practice in Python).  
3. Explore the results to understand how preprocessing works step by step.
